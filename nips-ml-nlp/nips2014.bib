  abstract = {Humor identification is a hard natural language understanding
  problem. We identify a subproblem --- the "that's what she said" problem ---
  with two distinguishing characteristics: (1) use of nouns that are
  euphemisms for sexually explicit nouns and (2) structure common in the
  erotic domain. We address this problem in a classification approach that
  includes features that model those two characteristics. Experiments on web
  data demonstrate that our approach improves precision by 12\% over baseline
  techniques that use only word-based features.},
