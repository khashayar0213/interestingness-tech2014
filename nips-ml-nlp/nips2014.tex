% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

We investigate the problem of automatic prediction of text interestingness and present an information theoretic approach for quantifying text interestingness in terms of text topic diversity.  Our hypothesis is, in many text domains, often an interesting concept is generated by mixing a diverse set of topics.  Given a word distributional model learned from text corpus, we present an algorithm that leverages {\sl Jensen-Shannon} divergence for measuring text diversity and demonstrate how such a measure correlates with text interestingness. We describe several different base-line algorithms and present results over two different data sets: a collection of e-commerce products from {\sl eBay} , and a collection of  {\sl NSF} Awards from $2007$ to $2012$.
