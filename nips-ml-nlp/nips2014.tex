\begin{abstract}

We investigate the problem of automatic prediction of text interestingness and present an information theoretic approach for quantifying text interestingness in terms of text topic diversity.  Our hypothesis is, in many text domains, often an interesting concept is generated by mixing a diverse set of topics.  Given a word distributional model learned from text corpus, we present an algorithm that leverages {\sl Jensen-Shannon} divergence for measuring text diversity and demonstrate how such a measure correlates with text interestingness. We describe several different base-line algorithms and present results over two different data sets: a collection of e-commerce products from {\sl eBay} , and a collection of  {\sl NSF} Awards from $2007$ to $2012$.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Figure~\ref{fig:ebay-products} shows examples of {\sl eBay} products selected from several gadget related categories. The top row (Figures~\ref{fig:standard-iphone-case}, \ref{fig:standard-speaker}, and \ref{fig:standard-speaker}) shows examples of ordinary products that one might often see at stores, online sites, etc. The bottom row (Figures~\ref{fig:eyeshadow-iphone-case}, \ref{fig:zeppelin-speaker}, and \ref{fig:geeky-clock}) show examples of the products from the same categories which have a more creative design and are unique, and hence can be thought as more interesting as they have also gained a significant traction on sites such as {\sl pinterest}\footnote{\url{www.pinterest.com}}. Our hypothesis is, many such products often present diversity in the text describing them. In examples \ref{fig:eyeshadow-iphone-case}, \ref{fig:zeppelin-speaker}, and \ref{fig:geeky-clock} we have highlighted words that offer the largest diversity in each case. Fro example, in at the context of iPhone cases, one would expect less to observe topics that relate to make up and so forth (Figure~\ref{fig:eyeshadow-iphone-case}).

\section{Our Approach}
\label{sec:our-approach}

\subsection{Word Representation}
\label{sec:word-representation}

We assume a distributional representation for the words in the vocabulary (for a brief review see~\cite{Turian10wordrepresentations}). A distributional representation over a vocabulary $W$ can be expressed in terms of a co-occurrence  matrix $A_{|W|\times|C|}$ where each row represents a co-occurrence of a word with a set of contexts deonted by $C$. For example if we chose $C=W$ we get the familiar {\sl  word-to-word} co-occurrence representation which counts the number of times two words co-occurred in a document corpus. Another choice would be to use the set of topics learned over a document corpus by LDA~\cite{Blei:2003:LDA:944919.944937} as the context. In our model rows of $A$ are then normalized in order to obtain a probability distribution over the context. We will use the notation $P_w$ to represent the probability distribution of a word $w$ over the context. We also use the notation $T=\{w_1,...,w_k\}$ for a text snippet\footnote{by text snippet we refer to a moderately short block of tex. For example in e-commerce data it could be the title of a product, or in Twitter it could be the tweets.} where $\{w_1,...,w_k\}$ are the words in th eorder they appear in the text. Given a word distributional, the notaion $T_{\cP}=\{P_{w_1},...,P_{w_k}\}$ gives the set of probability distributions over the words in the text. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Information Diversity}
\label{sec:information-diversity}

Given a distributional representation over a vocabulary $W$ and context $C$ with $P_w$ giving a probability distribution of a word $w$ over the context $C$, we can measure information diversity for a given text snippet $T=\{w_1,...,w_k\}$ and its distributional representation $T_{\cP}=\{P_{w_1},...,P_{w_k}\}$ as follows:

\bed
Given a distribution $P_w$, its {\sl importance} with respect to a
prior distribution $P$ is defined as 
\[D_w = D_{KL}(P_w\|P),\]
where $D_{KL}(\centerdot\|\centerdot)$ denotes the
{\sl Kullback-Leibler} Divergence.
\eed

\bed\label{mixture}
Given a set of distributions $T_{\cP}=\{P_{w_1},...,P_{w_k}\}$ and a
prior $P$, we
define a mixture distribution $P_T$ as
\[P_T=\sum_{i=1}^k d_{w_i} P_{w_i},\]
where $d_{w_i}=\frac{D_{w_i}}{\sum D_{w_j}}$ are the normalized
importances.
\eed

Essentially, $P_T$ is the weighted average of the set $T_{\cP}$, where
the weights are chosen according to the importances. Next we
define the diversity measure:

\bed\label{diversity}
We define the Jensen-Shannon Information Diversity of a set of
distributions $\cP_T$ with respect to 
prior $P$ as
\[D_S=\sum_{i=1}^k d_{w_i}D_{KL}(P_{w_i}\|P_T), \]
where $d_{w_i}$ and $P_T$ are as in the previous definition.
\eed
This definition is closely related to the 
{\em general Jensen-Shannon Divergence}, defined in~\cite{FugledeTopsoe}. Another
interesting theoretical property of Jensen-Shannon Information
Diversity is that it can be interpreted as a generalization of Shannon
entropy as a population diversity measure, however we will not go
into this here any further. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Text Diversity}
\label{sec:text-diversity}

 Applying this general model to the natural language requires some
 additional considerations. First, how do we obtain a topic
 ditribution for a given word, and what is the prior topic
 distribution. As the terminology suggests, we want to rely on a topic
 model. Specifically, suppose we have a set $\cT$ of documents, sentences or
 paragraphs of any length, in which we want to find the most diverse
 examples. Additionally, we have a large set $\cD$ of documents which
 has content {\em similar} to $\cT$. We will train a Latent Dirichlet
 Allocation (LDA) topic model on $\cD$, 
 and use it to analyze $\cT$. Of course, both sets could be identical,
 but $\cT$ may, for example, be a set of sentences or short messages,
which not suitable for training a good topic model on. In those cases,
as we will see, the fact that $\cT$ and $\cD$ do not 
 need to be identical will give our method a distinct advantage over
 competing approaches. The key component we will need from the topic
 model is the word-topic matrix $M$, where $M_{ij}$ is the number of
 times $i$-th word was assigned the $j$-th topics. So, if we
 probabilistically normalize
 the $i$-th row of $M$, it will be the topic assignment distribution
 for the $i$-th word in our dictionary. This is a good candidate for a
 topic distribution to use in our model. Similarly, we obtain a prior
 topic distribution by computing the proportions of overall topic
 assignments. This corresponds to summing up matrix $M$ along its
 columns, and then normalizing the resulting vector.

The proposed choice of topic distributions for words has some
shortcomings. First, consider a word $w$ which occurs only once (or very
few times in the entire set $\cD$. Then, its topic distribution will be
very concentrated. Assuming that the prior distribution is close to
uniform, that will give a very high importance to $w$, just because
there is not enough datapoints in our set to determine its {\em true}
topic distribution. 

Furthermore, if we interpret a topic distribution as representing the
{\em meaning} of a word, then having a fixed distribution for each
word would not be able to reflect the fact that words often have
different meanings in different contexts. In effect, all of the
meanings would be combined together, and likely the most frequent one
would dominate, distorting the results.

Finally, there is a fundamental problem with describing the meaning of
words by their topic distributions. It forces us to make an implicit
assumption that the topics form a basis that is, in certain sense,
orthogonal. Consider, for example, a word that has a narrow usage, so
that it is always assigned the same topic in our model. Then, its
distribution will show no relation with any other topics, even those
that may be closely related to it. This intuitively seems like a
misrepresentation of the meaning of that word. This issue was also
raised in [topsoe]. The solution proposed there incorporated topic
similarities into a new diversity measure. We will present a different
approach that also uses topic similarities.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Observer's Model}
\label{sec:observer-model}

We will now present a model of a human Observer $A$ that is being presented with
the set $\cT$ and is supposed to judge the {\em interestingness} of
each piece of text from it. Additionally, we assume that $A$ has
gained their linguistic knowledge by observing samples from the set
$\cD$. What is, then, the general meaning (topic distribution) of a word $w$,
from the Observer's viewpoint? A statistically adequate approach is to
take a Bayesian model with a Dirichlet prior. We observe occurrences
in set $\cD$ of topic assignments for $w$ to learn the posterior
distribution. However, instead of using the fixed assignments produced
by the topic model, we let the Observer choose their own assignment as
follows: given a pair $(w,t)$, where $t$ is the topic assignment given
by the model for a specific occurrence of $w$, the observer selects a
topic from some topic-similarity distribution $S_t$, conditional on
$t$. An appropriate Dirichlet prior can be derived from this by
looking at the overall topic assignments (not for a specific
word). What would we get if we fed those to the Observer, letting $A$
generate their own topic for each?  Denoting by $S$ the matrix with
rows of topic-similarity distributions and by $P$ the (row vector) topic
distribution coming from the word-topic matrix, we find that the
observer's prior will concentrate around the distribution described by
the product $\widehat{P}=PS^T$. Using Bayes's rule to calculate the Observer's
posterior probability, we get
\[\widehat{P}_w=\frac{\alpha PS^T + \mu_w P_wS^T}{\alpha+\mu_w},\]
where $\mu_w$ is the frequency of word $w$ in D, and $P_w$ is the
topic assignment distribution obtained from the word-topic matrix,
while $\alpha$ is the parameter that specifies the strength of the
prior.

Next, let us analyze the Observer's behavior when reading a text
segment from $\cT$. We treat each piece of text as a bag of words,
disregarding the order. Suppose, the set of words is $T=\{w_1,...,w_k\}$. We
have already established how the Observer understands each word
separately. However, given a set of words, each one exists in the
context of the others. We can describe that context using the mixture
distribution from Definition \ref{mixture}. Denote
$T_1=\{w_2,...,w_k\}$ as the set of all words in $T$ except
$w_1$. What is the appropriate topic distribution for $w_1$, given a
context mixture distribution $P_{T_1}$? For this, we can look more
closely at the LDA model we used to obtain the word-topic matrix. We
can think of it as being generated by the following process: first
drawing a topic form the prior topic distribution, then drawing a word
from that topic's word distribution. It is natural to ask what would
the matrix look like if we used $P_{T_1}$ as the topic distribution
instead of the prior, and what would be the corresponding topic
distribution for word $w_1$. 

\bep
Let $\widehat{P},\widehat{P}_{w_1},P_{T_1}$ be the topic prior, general
topic distribution for $w_1$, and the context distribution,
respectively. Then, the context dependent distribution defined as
above, will be
\[P^{T_1}_{w_1}(t)\propto \frac{\widehat{P}_{w_1}\!(t)P_{T_1}\!(t)}{\widehat{P}(t)}.\]
\eep

The danger with relying on $P^{T_1}_{w_1}$
is that if the distributions $\widehat{P}_{w_1}$ and $P_{T_1}$ are
mostly disjoint, than their product will be very small. In other
words, we would need a long sampling process in generating the
hypothetical word-topic count matrix to obtain a statistically
significant estimation of the $P^{T_1}_{w_1}$. Once again,
we turn to bayesian analysis: we let the Observer use
$\widehat{P}_{w_1}$ as their maximum likelihood estimator in a
Dirichlet prior, obtaining the following posterior solution:
\[\widehat{P}^{T_1}_{w_1}(t)\propto \beta \widehat{P}_{w_1}\!(t) + \frac{\widehat{P}_{w_1}\!(t)P_{T_1}\!(t)}{\widehat{P}(t)}.\]
