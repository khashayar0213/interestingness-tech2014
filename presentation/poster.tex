{\bf Goal:} Increase user engagement when shopping on eBay.

{\bf Solution:} Display ads for products that are {\em unique},

browsing them and clicking on the ads.

  by mixing a {\bf diverse set of topics}.
We can identify those topics from the words appearing in the
  product title (usually 10-12 words).

{\bf 1. Interesting iPhone cases on eBay.}

We hired workers from {\em AMT} to label a collection
of iPhone cases found on {\em Pinterest} and {\em
  eBay's}. 

The final data-set consists of 2179 positive and 9770
negative instances for 
a total of 11,949 instances, with product title used as input. 
The topic model was trained using Mallet on 2 million product
  titles, grouped by categories into 800 documents.

\medskip
{\bf 2. NSF abstracts (61,902, 200-300 words each).}

We used this set for training a topic model.
To get labeled data, we had to generate $5000$ artificial
  labeled examples, by mixing random abstracts.

Each word $w_i\in V$ is mapped to a {\bf probability distribution} $P_i$ over topics
$T$, using $\cM$.

% \medskip
% We start from a {\bf co-occurrence matrix} $\cM_{|V|\times|T|}$
%   where each row represents a co-occurrence of a word with the set
%   $T$. For $T=V$, this corresponds to the familiar {\em word-to-word}
%   co-occurrence representation.

 \medskip
 To obtain $\cM$, we use a {\bf topic model} trained with {\em Latent Dirichlet Allocation}.
