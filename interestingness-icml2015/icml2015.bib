  abstract = {Humor identification is a hard natural language understanding
  problem. We identify a subproblem --- the "that's what she said" problem ---
  with two distinguishing characteristics: (1) use of nouns that are
  euphemisms for sexually explicit nouns and (2) structure common in the
  erotic domain. We address this problem in a classification approach that
  includes features that model those two characteristics. Experiments on web
  data demonstrate that our approach improves precision by 12\% over baseline
  techniques that use only word-based features.},

  abstract = {Initial studies have shown that automatic inference of high-level image quality or aesthetics is very challenging. The ability to do so, however, can prove beneficial in many applications. In this paper, we define the aesthetics gap and discuss key aspects of the problem of aesthetics and emotion inference in natural images. We introduce precise, relevant questions to be answered, the effect that the target audience has on the problem specification, broad technical solution approaches, and assessment criteria. We then report on our effort to build real-world datasets that provide viable approaches to test and compare algorithms for these problems, presenting statistical analysis of and insights into them.},
