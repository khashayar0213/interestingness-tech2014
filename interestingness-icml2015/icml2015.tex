\begin{abstract}

We study the problem of automatic prediction of text interestingness and present an information theoretic approach for
quantifying it in terms of topic diversity. Our hypothesis is, in many text domains, often an interesting
concept is generated by mixing a diverse set of topics. Given a word distributional model, we present
an approach that leverages {\sl Jensen-Shannon} divergence for measuring text diversity and demonstrate how such a measure
correlates with text interestingness. We describe several different base-line algorithms and present results over two different
data sets: a collection of e-commerce products from {\sl eBay}, and a corpus of {\sl NSF} proposals.
