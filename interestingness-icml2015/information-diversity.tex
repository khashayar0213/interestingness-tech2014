\subsection{Distributional Representations}
\label{sec:distributional-representations}
Analyzing textual data often leads to a common general framework,
where we obtain a significant collection of text with each word
occurrence tagged with one (or several) among a set of
contexts. Moreover, naturally, every word occurrence can be mapped to a
vocabulary term (barring ambiguities). So, each word in the vocabulary
corresponds to a group of its occurrences, which leads to a
distribution over the set of contexts. A distributional representation
over a vocabulary $V$ maps a word in the vocabulary to a  
probability distribution over a fixed set of contexts $T$  (for a brief review
see~\cite{Turian10wordrepresentations}). Often we start by a
co-occurrence matrix $\cM_{|V|\times|T|}$ where each row represents a
co-occurrence of a word with the labels.
For example if we chose $T=V$ then we obtain the familiar {\sl
  word-to-word} co-occurrence representation which counts the number 
of times two words co-occurred in a document corpus. Another choice is
to use the set of topics learned over a document 
corpus by {\sl Latent Dirichlet Allocation}
(LDA)~\cite{Blei:2003:LDA:944919.944937} as the context. The rows of
$\cM_{|V|\times|T|}$ 
can then  benormalized in order to obtain a probability distribution over
the labels.
%  We will use the notation $P_w$ to represent 
% the probability distribution over the context  given a word $w$. We
% also use the notation $W=\{w_1,...,w_k\}$ for a bag of word
% representation of a text snippet. Given a word distributional
% representation, $\cP_{W}=\{P_{w_ 1},...,P_{w_k}\}$ denotes the set
% of probability distributions over the context for the words 
% in the text snippet.

\subsection{Jensen-Shannon Diversity}
\label{sec:jensen-shannon-divergence}
We pose the following question: what is the right model of diversity
in text, with respect to the above framework? % Notice, however, that we
% need not restrict ourselves to text, because the way our
% distributional model is formulated can be applied to any set of
% labeled elements partitioned into groups (each group corresponding to
% a vocabulary word). Suppose we have a set $S$ of elements divided into
% a collection $G$ of groups, by a function $g:S\rightarrow
% G$. Additionally, each element has a label assigned with
% $f:S\rightarrow T$. What is the diversity between the groups?
Our starting point is the notion of Shannon 
entropy, generally considered as a well-founded measure of diversity 
for a collection of elements represented by a
distribution. Here, the collection consists of words, and each word
appears many times in the data, so it provides
finer information about the context assignments. Assume, for the sake
of argument, that every occurrence of the same word had the same
context assigned to it in a given corpus - in which case we could 
uniquely identify a vocabulary term with a single context. We could then naturally obtain a
context distribution for the vocabulary, weighed by the frequencies of
each word in the dataset, and measure the entropy, thus obtaining the
diversity of words in the vocabulary, with respect to the given corpus. Consider a word $w$
sampled uniformly from the data. Let $X$ and $Y$ denote the random
variables correspoding to the 
appropriate vocabulary term and the assigned context,
respectively. If, as we temporarily assumed,
each vocabulary term has one uniquely assigned context, then $H(Y|X)=0$, so entropic diversity of the
assignment, $H(Y)$, will be trivially equal to the mutual information between $X$
and $Y$: 
\[I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X) =H(Y).\]
If we break the simplifying assumption, $H(Y)$ is no longer a
reasonable metric, because if all of the words had contexts assigned
uniformly at random, then their distributional representations would be
identical, so there would be no diversity between them, but $H(Y)$
in fact reaches its maximum value. However, as we will see, mutual
information $I(X;Y)$ provides a proper generalization of diversity in
this case. Moreover, we can formulate mutual information in terms of the
distributional representations of the words as follows:
\bed\label{jsd-definition}
Let $P(Y)=\Sigma d_g P_g$ be the distribution of contexts,
described as a mixture of distributional word representations
$P_g=P(Y|X=g)$, weighed by $d_g=P(X=g)$. Mutual information between
$X$ and $Y$ can now be derived as
\[ I(X;Y)= \sum_{g\in G} d_g D_{KL}(P_g\|P),\]
where $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
We will call it the {\bf Jensen-Shannon diversity} of that
mixture, and denote by $D_{JS}(\Sigma d_gP_g)$.
\eed

The name refers to the generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence measure, 
discussed in \cite{FugledeTopsoe}. The above derivation follows easily
from the corresponding definitions of KL-divergence and mutual
information. Note, that mutual information is symmetric with respect
to $X$ and $Y$, even though their roles in our model are not. This
suggests certain duality between contexts and words. Let us examine
some other basic properties of this measure.

\bep\label{jsd-properties}
Let $M=\Sigma d_g P_g$ be a mixture distribution. Jensen-Shannon
diversity of $M$ satisfies the following properties:
 \begin{enumerate}
   \item $D_{JS}(\Sigma d_gP_g)\geq 0$ with equality only when all
     distributions $P_g$ are equal.
   \item $D_{JS}(\Sigma d_gP_g)\leq H(M)$ with equality when all
     $P_g$ have singleton support (i.e. $P(t)=1$ for some $t\in T$).
 \end{enumerate}
\eep
The second property tells us that maximizing this measure means
pushing all distributions $P_g$ to the corners of the simplex and
therefore minimizing their uncertainty.
From this (and the earlier discussion), it follows that Jensen-Shannon
diversity can be seen as a direct generalization of entropic
diversity, when replacing fixed context assignments 
with distributional ones. 
Another known interpretation of Jensen-Shannon Diversity from
statistical point of view is that it is the expected KL-divergence
between the posterior distribution $P(Y|X)$ and the prior distribution
$P(Y)$. It represents the average number of bits of information
learned about the context of a word from knowing its distributional
representation.
