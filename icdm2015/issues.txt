Clarify why we use diversity to measure interestingness, and when
could this be problematic?

Clearly state, how our paper is different from (Bache et al., 2013),
and what is novel.

We should probably switch from "contexts" to "topics" everywhere.

Get rid of the Reader's Model or at least drastically simplify the
language.

Simplify the explanation of Information diversity. We can just discuss
it using the concrete example we have in the paper.

Expand the Experiments section with more details about data collection
and preprocessing.

Explain the role of NSF dataset as just to verify that our measure
gets diversity right (not interestingness in this case).

Carefully discuss the problem that is solved by topic similarities.

On the ICDM website, they strongly encourage making the data available
online (anonymously on dropbox) for the submission. Can we do that?
(Probably not)
