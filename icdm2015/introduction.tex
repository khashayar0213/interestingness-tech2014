With the rapid growth of e-commerce, new products are increasingly introduced into the market place on a daily basis.  A larger subset of these products consists of our daily needs or off-the-shelf products (Table~\ref{tab:ebay-standard-products}), while a much smaller subset can be attributed as {\em unique}, {\em creative}, {\em serendipitous}, or {\em interesting} (Table~\ref{tab:ebay-interesting-products}). The latter class of products often provoke an emotive response in users and give them a more engaging experience. Automatic discovery of these types of products is an important problem in e-commerce for creating an engaging experience for the users and encouraging them to return to the site for a much more fun shopping experince. Quantifying interestingness, however,  is a challenging problem for several reasons. First, the notion of interestingness is not very well defined. We only understand certain dimensions of interestingness, such as visual appeal in images, or humor in the text domain, among other dimensions. Second, interestingness is very subjective. However, we believe that there exists a class of products that appear interesting to a sufficiently large population of users (see sites such as {\em Pinterest\footnote{\url{www.pinterest.com}}}, for example).  

In this paper we present an information theoretic approach for quantifying certain dimensions of text interestingness. We hypothesize that many interesting text forms (e.g., a product title in e-commerce) often present diversity in terms of text describing them. For example, consider the products shown in the Table~\ref{tab:ebay-standard-products}. For each product, all the keywords observed in the title are expected to be seen together and thus offer less diversity in terms of the topics they represent. However, in examples shown in Table~\ref{tab:ebay-interesting-products}, the highlighted keywords 
offer the largest diversity in each case. In other words what makes these products textually interesting is the juxtaposition of keywords that one does not normally expect to see them together in a text form. As an example, in Figure~\ref{tab:ebay-interesting-products}(a), in the context of iPhone cases, one would not expect to observe topics that relate to makeup. Based on this hypothesis we introduce an information-theoretic approach for measuring topic diversity based on {\em Jensen-Shannon Diversity} and show how it correlates with text interestingness. First we show how to build a word-to-topic distributional model by learning an LDA~\cite{Blei:2003:LDA:944919.944937}, trained over a corpus of documents. Next, we introduce several techniques for improving the base model that smoothes the distributions based on topic similarities and keyword sailiency. Finally, we show how such a distributional model can be used to measure {\em Jensen-Shannon Diversity} for a given text. We also present results evaluating the performnce of our diversity metric in two different real world domains: (1) identifying interesting eBay products based on the diversity in their titles; (2) idenitifying the most diverse National Science Foundation Scholarship proposal abstracts (discussed in~\cite{bache:2013}). 

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:related-work} we briefly overview the related work. In Section~\ref{sec:information-diversity} we introduce {\em Jensen-Shannon Diversity} and discuss an approach for building a text model suitable for this metric. In Sections~\ref{sec:the-readers-model} and \ref{sec:topic-similarities} we present a set of enhancements to the base model. In Section~\ref{sec:experiments} we present our experiments followed by concluding remarks in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.
